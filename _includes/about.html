                    <p> I love to learn and build software.  Iâ€™ve been coding for about 4 years. I have experience programming in react, react-native, nodejs, postgresql, java, elixir/phoenix and iOS(swift).  One of my main goals is to make programming education more accessible to communities that are underrepresented in the tech sector.</p>
                    <p> Currently, I am obessed with productivity and scalability. I hope to work with a young startup since I believe that is where I will learn the most.</p>
                    <p> Other than that, other interests that I have are in music, exercise, sports, politics, cooking and learning about other cultures. </p>
